# Things went downhill from here

I really wanted to build a Taylor Swift Lyrics bot and for one of my attempts it was pretty ok but I messed around with it too much. The next best thing was to link my glitch site because it's pretty, features my enthusiasm for TS and I was too tired to start from scratch.

I found this code that functioned like a workflow similar to the Telegram Notifs and I wanted to try it out.

I don't think I did it right so feedback is much appreciated!

I ran Docker as per http://localhost/tutorial/ but I am still very confused about how it should function and if I did it right.
