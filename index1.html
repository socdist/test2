          <h3>The Misconception About reputation</h3>
          <p>
            Reputation is considered by many to be Taylor's "revenge"album and
            while initially there are elements of revenge and bitterness, upon
            closer listening, reputation is arguably Taylor's most romantic
            album because it was about finding love even in the darkest times.

          <h3>Speak Now</h3>
         
            Speak Now is famous for being written entirely by Taylor. At
            19,Taylor Swift paints a nuanced picture of love ranging from
            romantic love to familial love with the songs Sparks Fly and Never
            Grow Up. Break ups are no longer battles to be won but a quiet
            understanding that sometimes things just don't work out. Dear John,
            for me, is one of the most heartbreaking songs where Taylor sings
            with raw honesty about being taken advantage of. It is also why I
            despise John Mayer.

          <h3>Folklore</h3>
          <p>
            Released in the middle of the pandemic in 2020, Folklore was the
            sort of escapism we needed.From magical forests to thick,comforting
            cardigans, Folklore enveloped us in its warm, melanocholic embrace.
            Taylor's masterful lyricism was on full display with lines like,<br />"
            I knew you Tried to change the ending Peter losing Wendy, I knew you
            Leavin' like a father Running like water..."
            It comes as no surprise that she won Album of the Year at the 2021
            Grammy's, the first woman to have won that award three times.
